# Splunk-Dashboard-for-SSH-Logs
In this project, you'll build a Splunk dashboard for monitoring SSH logs. The dashboard will visualize login attempts, failed connections, and brute force attacks. You will create panels for SSH activity summaries and authentication trends. Geo-location analysis will highlight brute force origins.
